##Household Income as Percentage of the Poverty Threshold

This app allows the user to calculate their household income as a percentage of the poverty threshold.  This value is important for determining eligibility for a number of government assistance programs.  Based on the January 2016 Federal Poverty Guidelines, this app uses (a) household size and (b) household income to determine the user's current percentage of the poverty threshold.
